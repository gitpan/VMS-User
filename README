This module lets you retrieve most of the info available via the system
service GETUAI. It will also get a list of users in your SYSUAF if 
you have read access to it and execute access to AUTHORIZE.

To build and test with perl use:

    perl Makefile.pl
    mms
    mms test

If it tests OK, then

    mms install

to install it (mmk may be used in place of mms in the above commands). 
More info is in the POD documentation in the User.pm file.

VMS::User allows Perl programs to retrieve a list of users and get
information about their accounts. The information it returns is pretty much
equivalent to what AUTHORIZE provides.

This module can't violate VMS system security in any way that DCL can't, so
if you can see something with SYS$GETUAI, you can see it with VMS::User.
If you can't see the item with AUTHORIZE, you can't here, either.
